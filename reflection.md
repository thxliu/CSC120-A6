Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I feel like it makes it convenient to already have access to public methods within a parent class so that we don't have to constantly rewrite them with each new class we create. Getting used to using super() took a moment, but overall I feel more comfortable using it. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I feel that overall, my code for each class works. I think that the restock method in the Cafe class could be more specific as restocking every single item, even when an item doesn't need it, is excessive. My advice is to carefully study the hashtable documentation because although it shares similar methods to ArrayLists like get() and contains(), there are specific ones for keys only, values only, or both. Additionally, working through that made figuring out the for loop for printCollection() more difficult that looping through an ArrayList.
